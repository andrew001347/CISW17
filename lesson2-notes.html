    <h2> Summary for Lesson 2 </h2>
        <p>CSS, aka Cascading Style Sheets, allows you to take control of how you want to display your web content. It is a language that defines 
            style constructs such as fonts, colors, and positioning. CSS can be stored directly into an HTML file or 
            in a completely separate file using the .css file extension. An important thing to remember is that more specific styles can override 
            more general styles. For example, if an element has both a general style applied to it and a more specific style (like an inline style or 
            a class), the more specific style will take precedence and override the general style.</p>

        <p> You can write css by starting off the tag you want to manipulate. body { } and inside the { } you can type out the many different properties.
            (EX: font-size: 10pt;) Make sure to end every properties with ;. This indicates the end of the style. You can place CSS properties 3 ways.
            In a style tag on the html page, inline with the element, or as a separate file using the link tag. As stated earlier, CSS properties can be
            within the HTML file itself, but it can also be in a different file. You can do this be creating a link to the HTML document from the CSS file.
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> This link must be placed in the head tag of the HTML file.
        </p>

        <p>Layout properties: Properties that affect the positioning of elements on a web page, such as margins, padding, and alignment.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>block—The element is displayed on a new line, as in a new paragraph.</li>
            <li>list-item—The element is displayed on a new line with a list-item mark (bullet) next to it.</li>
            <li>inline—The element is displayed inline with the current paragraph.</li>
            <li>inline-block—The element is displayed as a block-level element inline with surrounding block elements.</li>
            <li>none—The element is not displayed; it is hidden.</li>
        </ul>
        

        <p>Formatting properties: Properties that affect the visual display of elements in a website, such as the font type, size, and color</p>
        <ul>
            <li>border-width—The width of the border edge</li>
            <li>border-color—The color of the border edge</li>
            <li>border-style—The style of the border edge</li>
            <li>border-left—The left side of the border</li>
            <li>border-right—The right side of the border</li>
            <li>border-top—The top of the border</li>
            <li>border-bottom—The bottom of the border</li>
            <li>border—All the border sides</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additionally you can style the border. (EX: border-style:solid;)</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>solid—A single-line border</li>
            <li>double—A double-line border</li>
            <li>dashed—A dashed border</li>
            <li>dotted—A dotted border</li>
            <li>groove—A border with a groove appearance</li>
            <li>ridge—A border with a ridge appearance</li>
            <li>inset—A border with an inset appearance</li>
            <li>outset—A border with an outset appearance</li>
            <li>none—No border</li>
            <li>hidden—Effectively the same as none</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>CSS Class is a custom set of formatting specifications that can be applied to any element in a web page. CSS classes are defined with a dot (.) 
            and are meant to be reusable. EX: h1.silly { font: 36pt Comic Sans; } h1.serious { font: 36pt Arial; } </p>
        <p> h1 class="silly">Marvin's Munchies Inc. This will inherit the h1.silly rules</p>
        <p> h1 class="serious">MMI Investor Information This will inherit the h1.serious rules</p>

        <p>CSS ID is a custom set of formatting specifications that can be applied to only one element in a web page. You can use IDs across a set of 
            pages—but only once within each page. They are meant to be unique and only used once. CSS ID are defined with a hashtag(#)
            EX: #title {font: 24pt Verdana, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif} </p>
        <p> p id="title">Some Title Goes Here</p>   
        
</body>
