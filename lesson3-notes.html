    <h2> Summary for Lesson 4 </h2>
    <p>JavaScript is an additional tool to spice up a webpage and to interact with users in new ways. It
        allows the website to respond to the user, make decisions, and automate repetitive tasks. The way
        JavaScript runs is usually within a browser and as a interpreted language. </p>

        <p>Here is a list of some of the possible things JavaScript can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display messages to users on the webpage, in the browser’s status line, or through alert boxes.</li>
            <li>Validate form contents and perform automatic calculations (e.g., displaying a running total in an order form).</li>
            <li>Animate or change images when the mouse moves over them.</li>
            <li>Create interactive ad banners.</li>
            <li>Detect the user's browser and perform advanced functions on supported browsers.</li>
            <li>Detect installed plug-ins and notify the user if any are required.</li>
            <li>Modify parts of a webpage dynamically without reloading it.</li>
            <li>Display or interact with data retrieved from a remote server.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Using JavaScript, we can also store data. In the script tag, you can write now = new Date();. Date()
            is a JavaScript build-in object that gets the date and times. This will then in turn be stored into now.
        </p>

        <p>Example:<br>
            &lt;script&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;now = new Date();
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;localtime = now.toString();
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;utctime = now.toGMTString();
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write(&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local time:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot; + localtime + &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;);
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;document.write(&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UTC time:&lt;/strong&gt; &quot; + utctime + &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;);
            <br>
            &lt;/script&gt;
        </p>
        

    <h2> Lesson 5: Validating and Debugging Your Code </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How to validate your HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>How to use Developer Tools to debug HTML and CSS/li>
        <li>How to use the JavaScript Console to debug JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Summary for Lesson 5 </h2>
    <p>As we create web pages, it is important to validate them to make sure they are error free and adhere to the current HTML and CSS 
        standards. This can be done by utilizing an online tool such as <a href="https://validator.w3.org">https://validator.w3.org</a>

    </p>

    <p>Alternatively we can also use the Developer Tools are are built into the browsers. This can be done by right clicking and selecting 
        inspect. This is useful as it makes debugging easier to identify, especially when the wrong tag is used.</p>

    <p>How do you include JavaScript in a web page?</p>
    <p>One way to include JavaScript is in the HTML document itself using the script tag. It can also be 
        placed within the body tag, the head tag, withing an HTML tag such as body or form, or in a completely separated file. This file is the .js
        extension. The best place to put JavaScript is inside the body tag at the very bottom. This ensures that the computer does not take all its 
        time trying to read the JavaScript before HTML and CSS are rendered.
