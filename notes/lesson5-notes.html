    <h2>Lesson 9: Working Margins, Padding, Alignment, and Floating</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>How to add margins around elements</li>
        <li>How to add padding within elements</li>
        <li>How to keep everything aligned</li>
        <li>How to use the float property</li>

    <h2> Summary for Lesson 9 </h2>
    <p>Margins and padding are for adding space around elements. Align and float are for placing your elements in relation to others.
      Margins add space outside of your element's boarders. Padding will add space inside the boarder. To set margin's value, you can 
      target them specifically by doing margin-top, or margin-left. You can also put them together by placing the values from top, right,
      bottom, and left, like a compass. Same principles apply with padding. 
    </p>

    <p>Elements will float horizontally, not vertically. This will sometimes cause problems when you are placing other elements.
      A work around this would be to use the clear property. Clear will ensure that no other floating elements will be there. 
      For example, clear: left will make sure no other floating elements are allowed to the left.

    <h2>Lesson 10: Understanding the CSS Box Model and Positioning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How to conceptualize the CSS box model</li>
        <li>How to change the box model the browser uses</li>
        <li>How to position your elements</li>
        <li>How to control the way elements stack up</li>
        <li>How to manage the flow of text</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2> Summary for Lesson 10 </h2>
    <p>The CSS Box Model</p>
    <p>Every element in HTML has a box around them. How this box is enclosed is (going outside to inside) margin, border, padding, and then the 
      content itself. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The margin is the area outside the element. It never has color; it is always transparent.</li>
      <li>The border extends around the element, on the outer edge of any padding. The border can be of several types, widths, and colors.</li>
      <li>The padding exists around the content and inherits the background color of the content area.</li>
      <li>The content is surrounded by padding.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> One thing to keep in mind is that each margin,border, padding, and content will have independent width and height. Meaning, You will need to
      take into account of the width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin-right to get the true width size.
      The same principles apply with the height. You need to add padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom + margin-top + margin-bottom to 
      get the true height.
    </p>

    <p>There is another set of properties in the CSS box model: outline properties:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>outline-width</li>
      <li>outline-style</li>
      <li>outline-color</li>
      <li>outline-offset</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The outline properties are similar to border properties but do not affect the box model or take up space. They are useful for adding visible edges 
      to elements without changing the layout. </p>
    
      <p>The box-sizing property allows us to change the padding, border, and margin. It takes in two values. The content-box and the border-box. Content-box is the 
        default value, but we can use the border-box aka the quirks mode. Any defined padding and border are included inside the assigned width and height values.
      </p>

      <p>We can start positioning the boxes by using the position property. The position property has 4 values it can hold. Relative, absolute, fixed, and static. From 
        these values you can assign them to be placed left, right, top, or bottom except for static. You can also control they way elements are stacked to each other by 
        utilizing the z-index.
      </p>
    <h2>Lesson 11: Using CSS to Do More with Lists, Text, and Navigation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How the CSS box model affects lists</li>
        <li>How to customize the list item indicator</li>
        <li>How to use list items and CSS to create an image map</li>
        <li>How navigation lists differ from regular lists</li>
        <li>How to create vertical navigation with CSS</li>
        <li>How to create horizontal navigation with CSS</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2> Summary for Lesson 11 </h2>
    <p>How the CSS Box Model Affects Lists</p>
    <p>Although you can have list specific style types, you can change the overall list structuring by manipulating the margin, padding, color, and background-color. 
      A cool trick to hide text but still show the properties of a link, is by offsetting the text-indent: -1000em; This will move the text way to the left of the 
      web page. 
    </p>

    <p>Primary navigation takes users to the introductory pages of main sections of the site; secondary navigation takes users to pages within a certain section of 
      the site. You can make them horizontal or vertial. When making list elements, it is a good idea to make a visual change to allow users to know it is a clickable 
      element. To style lists that are nested in a list, specify which list you want to target. Example,nav ul and nav ul li would style the first level, but we can go
      deeper by using nav ul ul and nav ul ul li to target the second list/the one nested in.
