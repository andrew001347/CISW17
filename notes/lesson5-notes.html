    <h2> Summary for Lesson 9 </h2>
    <p>Margins and padding are for adding space around elements. Align and float are for placing your elements in relation to others.
      Margins add space outside of your element's boarders. Padding will add space inside the boarder. To set margin's value, you can 
      target them specifically by doing margin-top, or margin-left. You can also put them together by placing the values from top, right,
      bottom, and left, like a compass. Same principles apply with padding. 
    </p>

    <p>Elements will float horizontally, not vertically. This will sometimes cause problems when you are placing other elements.
      A work around this would be to use the clear property. Clear will ensure that no other floating elements will be there. 
      For example, clear: left will make sure no other floating elements are allowed to the left.
