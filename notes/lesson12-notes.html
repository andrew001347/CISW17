    <h2 class="w3-container w3-teal">Lesson 25: JavaScript Best Practices</h2>

</header>
<div class="w3-container">
<ul>
    <li>Best practices for creating unobtrusive scripts.</li>
    <li>The importance of separating content, presentation, and behavior.</li>
    <li>The importance of following web standards to create cross-browser scripts.</li>
    <li>How to read and display browser information.</li>
    <li>How to use feature sensing to avoid errors.</li>
    <li>How to support older, less compliant browser versions.</li>
    <li>How to support non-JavaScript browsers.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Some of the best scripting practices include to be readable and easy to maintain, follows standars and won't be 
    crippled when a new version of a browser is released, pages that work without JavaScript, easily adapt the code from one site 
    or project. It is important to keep JavaScript to a minimum. Additionally, 
</p>

<p>Content presentation and behavior: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Content consists of the words that a visitor can read on your pages. You create the content as text and mark it up with HTML 
        to define different classes of content—headings, paragraphs, links, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>Presentation is the appearance and layout of the words, images, and other elements on each page—text formatting, fonts, colors, 
        and graphics. This is where the power of CSS comes into play.
    </li>
    <li>Behavior is what happens when you interact with a page—items that highlight when you move over them, forms you can submit, 
        and so on. This is where JavaScript enters into the picture for enhanced front-end interactivity, along with server-side 
        languages such as PHP and Ruby.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>As the web continues to advance forward, we want to be mindful of graceful degradation. Some of the earliest web browsers
    did not support images in HTML. To make it accessible, it is important to present something helpful to users whenever unsupported tag is encountered.
    Furthermore, there is accessibility problems with users such as limited vision/hearing.    
</p>
<p>We want to start off the HTML documents as simple as possible to ensure primitive browers can support it.
    In the end we can integrate progressive enhacement where we dynamically add features to make the site better looking. 
    When we are utlizing event listeners, we want to load the event in. EX: window.addEventListener('load', Startup, false);
    
    To handle unforseen errors we should implement the try catch statements. 
</p>


<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p> This lesson highlights the importance of not only user-friendly site, but code as well. We should keep JavaScript only when necessary
    and document our code to help other developers or our future selves to understand what the code is doing.
</p>

    <h2 class="w3-container w3-teal">Lesson 26: Using Third-Party JavaScript Libraries and Functions</h2>
    <div class="w3-container">

    <ul>
        <li>Why you might use a third-party JavaScript library or framework</li>
        <li>The differences between libraries and frameworks</li>
        <li>How and when you might use Angular, jQuery, React, and other third-party libraries</li>
        <li>How to download and use a popular third-party JavaScript library in your applications</li>
        <li>The benefits of JavaScript frameworks</li>
    </ul>
</div> 
    <p>There are many different types of Third-Party JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks. jQuery is a library
        that allows for DOM manipulation and cross-browser coding features. The Prototype library  simplifies 
        tasks such as working with DOM objects, dealing with data in forms, and remote scripting (AJAX). This 
        can be included with a simple Prototype.js file and with the &lt;script src="prototype.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        tag.  
    </p>

    <p>Using JavaScript Frameworks</p>
<p>JavaScript libraries are smaller, offering reusable code to enhance custom architectures, while frameworks are 
    larger and enforce a specific structure, like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. In MVC, applications are 
    divided into three components: Model (manages data and logic), View (displays information), and Controller 
    (handles user interactions).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Model</strong>—Acts as the central component, even though it’s listed first in the name, holding application data, business rules, functions, and other logical elements.</li>
    <li><strong>View</strong>—Requests information from the model to show to the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Controller</strong>—Sends information to the model for processing through user interactions.</li>
</ul>


    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Implementing code blindly is never a good thing. We should always try to understand what is happening in our code especially
        when we are third-party codes such as libraries and frameworks.
