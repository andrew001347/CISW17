      <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is adapting the website designs for optimal viewing. The design must be edit once, display anywhere.
        RWD is a combination of CSS, clean and valid HTML code, professive enhancement, feature,device and broswer detection using scripts,
        and server-side components to produce faster sites. RWD responds to the device's viewing display size and resolution. 
      </p>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is the process of creating a strong foundation on a website and then adding enhancement to that foundation. 
        Progressive enhancement switches the focus from what browsers and devices customers use, to focusing on the content the web page will 
        display. This approach allows for websites to be inclusive and accessible. Progressive enhancements can be done by separating 
        content from presentation and functionality. The HTML must be written correctly and should be validated by utlizing the correct semantics
        and tags. CSS will be used to adjust how the content will look only, and JavaScript will add interactivity.
