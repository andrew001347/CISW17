    <h2>Lesson 16: Understanding the Importance of Responsive Web Design</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>What is responsive web design (RWD)</li>
        <li>Why we need RWD</li>
        <li>What is progressive enhancement</li>
        <li>How to write HTML that’s RWD ready</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Summary for Lesson 16</p>

      <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is adapting the website designs for optimal viewing. The design must be edit once, display anywhere.
        RWD is a combination of CSS, clean and valid HTML code, professive enhancement, feature,device and broswer detection using scripts,
        and server-side components to produce faster sites. RWD responds to the device's viewing display size and resolution. 
      </p>
      <p>Progressive enhancement is the process of creating a strong foundation on a website and then adding enhancement to that foundation. 
        Progressive enhancement switches the focus from what browsers and devices customers use, to focusing on the content the web page will 
        display. This approach allows for websites to be inclusive and accessible. Progressive enhancements can be done by separating 
        content from presentation and functionality. The HTML must be written correctly and should be validated by utlizing the correct semantics
        and tags. CSS will be used to adjust how the content will look only, and JavaScript will add interactivity.

    <h2>Lesson 17: Designing for Mobile Devices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How mobile design differs from standard web design</li>
        <li>What the Mobile First design philosophy is</li>
        <li>How Mobile First is important to RWD</li>
        <li>How to build responsive tables and images for mobile devices</li>
        <li>How to use CSS columns to create responsive designs without media queries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Summary for Lesson 17</p>

    <p>As more and more people access the web with mobile devicces, the need for good mobile design increases.
      https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly this website is a tool that can help you if the web page is mobile friendly. 

    </p>
    <p>There are a few specific things that Google looks for when assessing a site for mobile friendliness:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Flash</li>
      <li>Configuring the viewport</li>
      <li>Fixed-width designs</li>
      <li>Image and other box sizes</li>
      <li>Font sizes</li>
      <li>Tappable elements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some things to consider when making a mobile-friendly site is simplifying layout/navigation, keeping download times short, and testing on real devices. 
      Avoid using flash and utilzie animation instead. The base font should be font-size: 16px. Instead of using fixed sizes, use % and rem instead. Another thing
      to remember is the line height. The typical line-height is 0.8 and for paragraphs it should be 1.1.  
    </p>

    <p>Desinging with mobile first design focuses on the content first. For example, a mobile customer might be more interested in the hours and location of a restaurant, 
      while a computer user might want the menus first. It’s not that mobile customers don’t want the menus, but menus might not be
       their first focus. You can implement a felxible image like this: img { width: 100%; max-width: 100%; height: auto; } in the css file. You can also implement flexible 
       images directly in the HTML by using different pixel densities or the width of the device. Common device widths are  320px, 480px, 760px, 960px, 1200px, 1600px.
       Start designing smallest screen and move up. 
      </p>

      
    

    <h2>Lesson 18: Using Media Queries and Breakpoints</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>How to write a CSS media query</li>
        <li>How to use different media types</li>
        <li>How to create media query expressions</li>
        <li>Understanding logical keywords in your queries</li>
        <li>What CSS breakpoints are</li>
        <li>How to define breakpoints</li>
        <li>How to find the best breakpoints for your website</li>
      </ul>
      
    <p>Summary for Lesson 18</p>

    <p>Media queries are work like if/then statements based on the devices viewing page. 

    </p>

    <p>There are 10 media types that CSS can utilize with media queries:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All—All media</li>
      <li>Braille—Braille and tactile feedback devices</li>
      <li>Embossed—Paged braille printers</li>
      <li>Handheld—Small-screen low-bandwidth handheld devices</li>
      <li>Print—Paged media and documents in print preview mode</li>
      <li>Projection—Projected presentations</li>
      <li>Screen—Color computer screens</li>
      <li>Speech—Speech synthesizers</li>
      <li>TTY—Teletypes and media with a fixed-pitch character grid</li>
      <li>TV—Television</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Media queries also allows for expressions to be utilized. The and expression combines features and types together. the comma-separated list is the OR logical expression
      equivalent. A not expression will negate the entire query. The only expression can prevent browsers that do not support media queries from applying the styles. 
    </p>

    <p>Examples of media query expressions: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AND: @media (min-width: 760px) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }</li>
      <li> Comma-separated list (OR):@media (min-width: 760px), (orientation: landscape) { ... }</li>
      <li>NOT (!): @media not (min-width: 760px) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }</li>
      <li>only: @media only screen { ... }</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Breakpoints are most commonly done by the width of the device. Optimal breakpoints should be based on the websites design. Breakpoints should have a 1px difference.
        So when moving to a different breakpoint, the next breakpoint should be exactly 1px different than the previous one. It is important to consider the device's orientation and not
        just the width. Additionally, some devices utilize retina. Pages displayed on Retina displays and other high-pixel-density devices can look bad if your images aren’t optimized for them.
