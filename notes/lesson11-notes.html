    <p>Summary for Lesson 23</p>
    <p>The if statement is the main conditional statement in JavaScript. In this conditional statement we can also add 
        and else keyword to add additional commands if the IF statement is not met. A conditional expression usually includes 
        two balues to be compared and a conditional operator to compare the values. Some conditional operators are: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>== — Is equal to</li>
        <li>!= — Is not equal to</li>
        <li>&lt; — Is less than</li>
        <li>&gt; — Is greater than</li>
        <li>&gt;= — Is greater than or equal to</li>
        <li>&lt;= — Is less than or equal to</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We can also use logical operators such as ||(OR), &&(AND), and !(NOT)  </p>
      
      <p>Examples: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>if ((phone == "") || (email == "")) alert("Something Is Missing!");</li>
        <li>if ((phone == "") && (email == "")) alert("Both Values Are Missing!");</li>
        <li>if (phone != "") alert("phone is OK"); or if (!phone == "") alert("phone is OK"); </li>
      </ul>
    <p>Shorthand Conditional Expressions: </p>
    <code>
        variable= (condition) ? (value if true) : (value if false);

        value = (a == 1) ? 1 : 0; //if the value is 1 make it 1, else 0

        is the same as 

        if (a == 1) {

            value = 1;
         
         } else {
         
            value = 0;
         
         }
    </code>

<p>There are multiple ways to make loops/checking points. One is the switch statement, and as the name suggests,
    includes an initial statement and swtiches if that statement does not match. For loops uses a variable to keep track 
    of how many times the loop has executed and stops when it reaches the desired number. While uses can be like for loops 
    but they continue the loop as long as the condition is true. A do...while loop will be tested at the end of the loop 
    rather than the beginning, meaning that the commands inside the loop will always execute at least once.   
</p>

<p>Loops are an excellent way to write up repetative tasks. It is especially usuful when working with arrays. </p>
      

    <h2>Lesson 24: Responding to Events and Using Windows</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How event handlers work</li>
        <li>How event handlers relate to objects</li>
        <li>How to create an event handler</li>
        <li>How to detect mouse and keyboard actions</li>
        <li>How to use onclick to change the appearance of &lt;div&gt;</li>
        <li>How to access and use the window object hierarchy with JavaScript</li>
        <li>How to delay a script’s actions by using timeouts</li>
        <li>How to display alerts, confirmations, and prompts</li>
      </ul>


      
    <p>Event handlers are among the most powerful features of JavaScript. To utilize it we do not need to use the 
      script tag. Instead we use the event name and code to invoke the event handler as an attribute of an individual
      HTML tag. For example: 
    </p>
    <code><a href="http://www.google.com/"
      onmouseover="alert('You moved over the link.');">
      This is a link.</a>

      We can also use it to call a function:
      <a href="#bottom"onmouseover="doIt();">Move the mouse over this link.</a>


    </code>
    <p>Event handlers are stored as properties of the document object or another object that can receive an event. 
      There are many events you can listen for. The click event can be used to invoke all sorts of actions. 
      These are some of the most commonly used ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>focus — When the element is focused on with a mouse or keyboard (tab).</li>
      <li>blur — When the element loses focus.</li>
      <li>click — When the element is clicked.</li>
      <li>dblclick — When the element is clicked twice.</li>
      <li>keydown — When a key is pressed down.</li>
      <li>keyup — When a key is released.</li>
      <li>keypress — When a key is pressed, relaying the key value.</li>
      <li>mouseover — When the mouse pointer is over the element.</li>
      <li>mouseout — When the mouse pointer is moved off an element after hovering.</li>
      <li>mousemove — When the mouse moves.</li>
      <li>mousedown — When the mouse button is pressed over an element.</li>
      <li>mouseup — When the mouse button is released over an element.</li>
      <li>load — When the element has fully loaded.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Common properties of the event object: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>event.modifiers — A flag that indicates which modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, etc.) were held down during the event. This value is an integer that combines binary values representing the different keys.</li>
      <li>event.pageX — The x coordinate of the event within the web page.</li>
      <li>event.pageY — The y coordinate of the event within the web page.</li>
      <li>event.which — The key code for keyboard events (in Unicode) or the button that was pressed for mouse events.</li>
      <li>event.button — The mouse button that was pressed. The left button’s value is 0, and the right button’s value is 2. If the mouse has a middle button, the value is 1.</li>
      <li>event.target — The object where the event occurred.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We can keep track of keybaord actions with the event handler keypress. </p>

    <p>Properties of the window Object: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>window.closed — Indicates whether the window has been closed. Useful when working with multiple windows, as the current window containing the script cannot be closed without ending the script.</li>
      <li>window.name — Specifies the name for a window opened by a script.</li>
      <li>window.opener — In a new window opened by a script, provides a reference to the window containing the script that opened it.</li>
      <li>window.outerHeight and window.outerWidth — Specify the height and width, respectively, of the outside of a browser window.</li>
      <li>window.screen — Provides a child object that stores information about the screen the window is in, including resolution, color depth, and more.</li>
      <li>window.self — Acts as a synonym for the current window object.</li>
    </ul>
