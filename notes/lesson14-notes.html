    <p>Summary for lesson 14</p>
    <p>Having a single page web allows for all the information on the site to download quickly, the whole site can be printed on a single print 
        page, visitors can save the site on their hard drives for future reference, and links between different parts on the same page
        may respond more quickly. 
    </p>

    <p>The goal of a website is to make other webpages visitable and act as a portal to access information with sites. A common mistake beginner web-designers make 
        is that different pages look fundamentally different from each other. A good web design should strive for unifomity within the site itself. It should also 
        adhear to a unique and unmistakable visual theme to make it stand out from all the other web sites on the internet. 

    </p>

    <p>In order to optimize websites for the search engine, you should note the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Interesting content—This is the most important feature of a search engine–friendly site. You need to have text, multimedia, and images that people want to read and view.</li>
    <li>Easy-to-use navigation—You want visitors to your site to stay as long as they want, no matter what page they end up on.</li>
    <li>Mobile friendliness—Mobile-friendly sites are critical for search engine placement. More and more people use mobile devices, and Google and other search engines are switching to an index that prioritizes mobile-friendly designs.</li>
</ul>

    
  


    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        This lesson highlights the importance of organizing websites with consistent design and clear navigation to ensure a cohesive user experience.
        Version control and frameworks like Bootstrap are introduced as tools to streamline development and improve efficiency, especially for larger projects.
