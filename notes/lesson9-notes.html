    <h1> Lesson 9 Notes </h1>
    <h2>Lesson 19: Understanding Dynamic Websites and HTML5 Applications</h2>

</header>
<ul>
    <li>How to conceptualize different types of dynamic content</li>
    <li>How to include JavaScript in your HTML</li>
    <li>How to display randomized text with JavaScript</li>
    <li>How to change images by using JavaScript and user events</li>
    <li>How to begin thinking ahead to putting all the pieces together to create HTML5 applications</li>
</ul>

    <p>Summary of Lesson 19</p>
    <p>There are 2 types of scripting exist. The server side and the client side. Server side scripting are scripts that run on the web server which sends
        results to the web browser. Client side scripting are scripts that run within web browsers and have no interaction with a 
        web server to have functionality. 
    </p>

    <p>We can include JavaScript 2 ways. One directly into the HTML using the script tag or we can use a .js file to link it to the HTML file. 
        The DOM aka document object model is the stucture of the web document. It is the overall framework. You start with document.(id).____

    </p>

    <p>You can write comments with two forward slashes //. These comments are for giving other people/developers a comment on what the code is trying to accomplish.
         /*  */ This also works to comment things. Anything placeed between the /*  */ will be commented out which can comment out multiple lines.
        Comments help make code easier to understand and useful for marking sections of a script. 
    </p>

    <h2>Lesson 20: Getting Started with JavaScript Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How and why to organize scripts using functions</li>
        <li>What objects are and how JavaScript uses them</li>
        <li>How JavaScript can respond to events</li>
        <li>How and when to use conditional statements and loops</li>
        <li>How browsers execute scripts in the proper order</li>
        <li>Basic syntax rules for avoiding JavaScript errors</li>
        <li>What JSON is and how it can be used</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Summary of Lesson 20</p>

    <p>Statements are the basic units of JavaScript program. now = new Date();

        hours = now.getHours();
        
        mins = now.getMinutes();
        
        secs = now.getSeconds();

        You must end JavaScript with a ;, because it marks the end of the statement.
    </p>

    <p>JavaScript supports 3 kinds of objects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built-in objects: These objects are built directly into the JavaScript language. These objects are Date, Array, String, to name a few.</li>
        <li>DOM (Document Object Model) objects:These objects represent various components of the browser and the current HTML document. For example, the alert() function you used earlier in this lesson is actually a method of the window object.  </li>
        <li>Custom objects: These objects are objects created by the developer.</li>
 
    </ul> 

    <p>Scripts that are within the head tag are handled first. These scripts will not create output, so it is best practice to only define function to be used later.
        Reserved words are words built into the JavaScript language, and as such can not be used to name variables/objects. 
    </p>

    <p>Best Practices for JavaScript</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use comments liberally—Comments make your code easier for others to understand and also easier for you to understand when you edit it later. They are also useful for 
            marking the major divisions of a script.
        </li>
        <li>Use a semicolon at the end of each statement and use only one statement per line—Although you learned in this lesson that you do not have to end each statement with a 
            semicolon (if you use a new line), using semicolons and only one statement per line will make your scripts easier to read and also easier to debug.
        </li>
        <li>Use external JavaScript files whenever possible—Separating JavaScript into external files helps pages load more quickly and also encourages you to write modular scripts 
            that can be reused.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid being browser specific—As you learn more about JavaScript, you’ll learn some features that work in only one browser. Avoid such features unless absolutely necessary, 
            and always test your code in more than one browser to ensure that everything works.
        </li>
        <li>Keep JavaScript optional—Don’t use JavaScript to perform an essential function on your site (for example, for the primary navigation links). Whenever possible, users without
             JavaScript should be able to use your site, although it might not be quite as attractive or convenient without the JavaScript. This strategy is known as progressive enhancement.
            </li>
    </ul>

    <p>JSON: JavaScript Object Notation formalized the idea of encoding data in JavaScript.
        var yourJSONObject = {
            "param1":"value1",
            "param2":"value2",
            "param3":"value3"
         };

         JSON are mostly used for data interchange format used by application programming interfaces by
         exchanging data in a string format, by serilization.
    </p>

    

    <h2>Lesson 21: Working with the Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How the W3C DOM standard makes dynamic pages easier to control</li>
        <li>The basics of the standard DOM objects: window, document, history, and location</li>
        <li>How to work with DOM nodes, parents, children, and siblings</li>
        <li>How to access and use the properties of DOM nodes</li>
        <li>How to access and use DOM node methods</li>
        <li>How to control element positioning with JavaScript</li>
        <li>How to hide and show elements with JavaScript</li>
        <li>How to use JavaScript to add and modify text within a page</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Summary for Lesson 21</p>
    <p>The very top of the browser object hierarchy is the window object. Objects are distinct instance of the browser and will only work on the 
        one actively being used. 
        
    </p>

    <p>Some document object properties: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>document.URL—Specifies the document’s URL. You (or your code) cannot change the value of this property.</li>
        <li>document.title—Refers to the title of the current page, defined by the HTML &lt;title&gt; tag. You can change the value of this property.</li>
        <li>document.referrer—Returns the URL of the page the user was viewing before the current page—usually the page with a link to the current page. 
            As with document.URL, you cannot change the value of document.referrer. Note that document.referrer will be blank if a user has directly accessed a given URL directly.</li>
        <li>document.lastModified—Indicates the date the document was last modified. This date is sent from the server along with the page.</li>
        <li>document.cookie—Enables you to read or set a cookie used within the document.</li>
        <li>document.images—Returns a collection of images used in the document.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Document.write can only be utilized in the body tag and/or used in a function. Additionally the function must be in the body tag. </p>

    <p>history.length—Keeps track of the length of the history list—in other words, the number of different locations the user has visited.</p>
    <p>3 methods</p>
    <ul>
        <li>history.go—Opens a URL from the history list. To use this method, specify a positive or negative number in parentheses. For example, history.go(−2) is
             equivalent to clicking the Back button twice.</li>
        <li>history.back—Loads the preceding URL in the history list. This is equivalent to clicking the Back button or using history.go(−1).</li>
        <li>history.forward—Loads the next URL in the history list, if available. This is equivalent to clicking the Forward button or using history.go(1).</li>
    </ul>
    
<!--
    Button made back and forward button instead of the built-in browser.
    <button type="button"onclick="history.back();">Go Back</button>
    <button type="button"onclick="history.forward();">Go Forward</button>

-->

<p>Location Objects: </p>
<ul>
    <li>location.protocol—The protocol part of the URL (http in this example)</li>
    <li>location.hostname—The hostname of the URL (www.google.com in this example)</li>
    <li>location.port—The port number of the URL (443 in this example)</li>
    <li>location.pathname—The filename part of the URL (search in this example)</li>
    <li>location.search—The query portion of the URL, if any (q=javascript in this example)</li>
    <li>location.host—The hostname of the URL plus the port number (for example, www.google.com:443)</li>
    <li>location.hash—The anchor name used in the URL, if any (for example, www.google.com/#home)</li>
</ul>

<p>Location has 3 methods. location.assign will load a new document page.  location.reload will reload the current document, and location.replace will replace the current location with a new one.</p>

<p>Basic Node Properties: </p>

<ul>
    <li>nodeName—The name of the node (not the ID). For nodes based on HTML tags, such as &lt;p&gt; or &lt;body&gt;, the name is the tag name: p or body. For the document node, the name is a special code: #document. 
        Similarly, text nodes have the name #text. This is a read-only value.</li>
    <li>nodeType—An integer describing the node’s type, such as 1 for normal HTML tags, 3 for text nodes, and 9 for the document node. This is a read-only value.</li>
    <li>nodeValue—The actual text contained within a text node. This property returns null for other types of nodes.</li>
    <li>innerHTML—The HTML content of any node. You can assign a value including HTML tags to this property and change the DOM child objects for a node dynamically.</li>
</ul>

<p>Node Relationships: </p>
<ul>
    <li>firstChild—The first child object for a node. For nodes that contain text, such as &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt;, the text node containing the actual text is the first child.</li>
    <li>lastChild—The node’s last child object.</li>
    <li>childNodes—An array that includes all of a node’s child nodes. You can use a loop with this array to work with all the nodes under a given node.</li>
    <li>previousSibling—The sibling (node at the same level) previous to the current node.</li>
    <li>nextSibling—The sibling after the current node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Document Methods: </p>
<ul>
    <li>getElementById(id)—Returns the element with the specified id attribute.</li>
    <li>getElementsByTagName(tag)—Returns an array of all the elements with a specified tag name. You can use the wildcard * to return an array containing all the nodes in the document.</li>
    <li>createTextNode(text)—Creates a new text node containing the specified text, which you can then add to the document.</li>
    <li>createElement(tag)—Creates a new HTML element for the specified tag. You need to add the element to the document after creating it. You can assign content within the element by changing its child objects or the innerHTML property.</li>
</ul>
<p>Node Methods: </p>
<ul>
    <li>appendChild(new)—Appends the specified new node after all the object’s existing nodes.</li>
    <li>insertBefore(new, old)—Inserts the specified new child node before the specified old child node, which must already exist.</li>
    <li>replaceChild(new, old)—Replaces the specified old child node with a new node.</li>
    <li>removeChild(node)—Removes a child node from the object’s set of children.</li>
    <li>hasChildNodes—Returns true if the object has one or more child nodes, or false if it has none.</li>
    <li>cloneNode—Creates a copy of an existing node. If a parameter of true is supplied, the copy will also include any child nodes of the original node.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the visibility property, you can hide or show objects. </p>
