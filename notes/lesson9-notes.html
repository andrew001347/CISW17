    <p>Summary of Lesson 19</p>
    <p>There are 2 types of scripting exist. The server side and the client side. Server side scripting are scripts that run on the web server which sends
        results to the web browser. Client side scripting are scripts that run within web browsers and have no interaction with a 
        web server to have functionality. 
    </p>

    <p>We can include JavaScript 2 ways. One directly into the HTML using the script tag or we can use a .js file to link it to the HTML file. 
        The DOM aka document object model is the stucture of the web document. It is the overall framework. You start with document.(id).____
