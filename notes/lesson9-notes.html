    <h1> Lesson 9 Notes </h1>
    <h2>Lesson 19: Understanding Dynamic Websites and HTML5 Applications</h2>

</header>
<ul>
    <li>How to conceptualize different types of dynamic content</li>
    <li>How to include JavaScript in your HTML</li>
    <li>How to display randomized text with JavaScript</li>
    <li>How to change images by using JavaScript and user events</li>
    <li>How to begin thinking ahead to putting all the pieces together to create HTML5 applications</li>
</ul>

    <p>Summary of Lesson 19</p>
    <p>There are 2 types of scripting exist. The server side and the client side. Server side scripting are scripts that run on the web server which sends
        results to the web browser. Client side scripting are scripts that run within web browsers and have no interaction with a 
        web server to have functionality. 
    </p>

    <p>We can include JavaScript 2 ways. One directly into the HTML using the script tag or we can use a .js file to link it to the HTML file. 
        The DOM aka document object model is the stucture of the web document. It is the overall framework. You start with document.(id).____

    </p>

    <p>You can write comments with two forward slashes //. These comments are for giving other people/developers a comment on what the code is trying to accomplish.
         /*  */ This also works to comment things. Anything placeed between the /*  */ will be commented out which can comment out multiple lines.
        Comments help make code easier to understand and useful for marking sections of a script. 
    </p>

    <h2>Lesson 20: Getting Started with JavaScript Programming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How and why to organize scripts using functions</li>
        <li>What objects are and how JavaScript uses them</li>
        <li>How JavaScript can respond to events</li>
        <li>How and when to use conditional statements and loops</li>
        <li>How browsers execute scripts in the proper order</li>
        <li>Basic syntax rules for avoiding JavaScript errors</li>
        <li>What JSON is and how it can be used</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Summary of Lesson 20</p>

    <p>Statements are the basic units of JavaScript program. now = new Date();

        hours = now.getHours();
        
        mins = now.getMinutes();
        
        secs = now.getSeconds();

        You must end JavaScript with a ;, because it marks the end of the statement.
    </p>

    <p>JavaScript supports 3 kinds of objects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built-in objects: These objects are built directly into the JavaScript language. These objects are Date, Array, String, to name a few.</li>
        <li>DOM (Document Object Model) objects:These objects represent various components of the browser and the current HTML document. For example, the alert() function you used earlier in this lesson is actually a method of the window object.  </li>
        <li>Custom objects: These objects are objects created by the developer.</li>
 
    </ul> 

    <p>Scripts that are within the head tag are handled first. These scripts will not create output, so it is best practice to only define function to be used later.
        Reserved words are words built into the JavaScript language, and as such can not be used to name variables/objects. 
    </p>

    <p>Best Practices for JavaScript</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use comments liberally—Comments make your code easier for others to understand and also easier for you to understand when you edit it later. They are also useful for 
            marking the major divisions of a script.
        </li>
        <li>Use a semicolon at the end of each statement and use only one statement per line—Although you learned in this lesson that you do not have to end each statement with a 
            semicolon (if you use a new line), using semicolons and only one statement per line will make your scripts easier to read and also easier to debug.
        </li>
        <li>Use external JavaScript files whenever possible—Separating JavaScript into external files helps pages load more quickly and also encourages you to write modular scripts 
            that can be reused.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid being browser specific—As you learn more about JavaScript, you’ll learn some features that work in only one browser. Avoid such features unless absolutely necessary, 
            and always test your code in more than one browser to ensure that everything works.
        </li>
        <li>Keep JavaScript optional—Don’t use JavaScript to perform an essential function on your site (for example, for the primary navigation links). Whenever possible, users without
             JavaScript should be able to use your site, although it might not be quite as attractive or convenient without the JavaScript. This strategy is known as progressive enhancement.
            </li>
    </ul>

    <p>JSON: JavaScript Object Notation formalized the idea of encoding data in JavaScript.
        var yourJSONObject = {
            "param1":"value1",
            "param2":"value2",
            "param3":"value3"
         };

         JSON are mostly used for data interchange format used by application programming interfaces by
         exchanging data in a string format, by serilization.
    </p>

    

    <h2>Lesson 21: Working with the Document Object Model (DOM)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How the W3C DOM standard makes dynamic pages easier to control</li>
        <li>The basics of the standard DOM objects: window, document, history, and location</li>
        <li>How to work with DOM nodes, parents, children, and siblings</li>
        <li>How to access and use the properties of DOM nodes</li>
        <li>How to access and use DOM node methods</li>
        <li>How to control element positioning with JavaScript</li>
        <li>How to hide and show elements with JavaScript</li>
        <li>How to use JavaScript to add and modify text within a page</li>
    </ul>
