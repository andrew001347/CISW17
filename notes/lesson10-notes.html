    <p>Summary for Lesson 22</p>

<p>Variables are named containers that can store different data types. Some rules to follow when naming your variables:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Variable names can include letters of the alphabet, both upper- and lowercase. They can also include the digits 0–9 and the underscore (_) character.</li>
    <li>Variable names cannot include spaces or any other punctuation characters.</li>
    <li>The first character of the variable name must be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
    <li>Variable names are case sensitive; for example, <code>totalnum</code>, <code>Totalnum</code>, and <code>TotalNum</code> are interpreted as separate variable names.</li>
    <li>There is no official limit on the length of a variable name, but it must fit on one line. If your variable names are longer than that—or even longer than 25 or so characters—you might consider a different naming convention.</li>
</ul>

<p> Variables can be two types, a global and local variable. Global variables can be accessed in the entire script, while local variables have a single function as their scope.
    Unless the var keyword is utilized outside the function, the var keyword is used to make a local variable. 
</p>

<p>JavaScript Operators: </p>
<ul>
    <li><code>+</code> Concatenate (combine) strings<br>
        <code>message = "this is" + " a test";</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>+</code> Add<br>
        <code>result = 5 + 7;</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>−</code> Subtract<br>
        <code>score = score − 1;</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>*</code> Multiply<br>
        <code>total = quantity * price;</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>/</code> Divide<br>
        <code>average = sum / 4;</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>%</code> Modulo (remainder)<br>
        <code>remainder = sum % 4;</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>++</code> Increment<br>
        <code>tries++;</code>
        <code>++tries; - this will add first before doing the next command.</code>
    </li>
    <li><code>--</code> Decrement<br>
        <code>total--;</code>
        <code>--total; - this will subtract first before doing the next command.</code>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>JavaScript Data Types: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Number—Examples of numbers are 3, 25, and 1.4142138. JavaScript supports both integers and floating-point numbers.</li>
    <li>Boolean—Booleans are logical values. A Boolean can have one of two values, true or false, and is useful for indicating whether a certain condition is true.</li>
    <li>String—A string, such as "I am a jelly doughnut", consists of one or more characters of text. (Strictly speaking, strings are String objects, which you’ll learn about later in this lesson.)</li>
    <li>Null—The null value, represented by the keyword null, is the value of an undefined variable. For example, the statement document.write(fig) will result in a null value (and an error message) if the variable fig has not been previously used or defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you can convert between data types. parseInt will convert a string into a float and parseFloat will make a string into a float value.
    For example: var stringvar = "30 angry polar bears"; var numvar = parseInt(stringvar); This will result into numvar = 30.
</p>

<p>Create string objects with the keyword new. var stringtest = "This is a test"; stringtest = new String("This is a test"); These two variables are creating the same object containing the words This is a test. with
    the variable names stringtest. The second way invovles using object oriented syntax. 
</p>

<p>Some neat tricks you can do with string is calcualte the length of the string with .length. Additionally, you can use toUpperCase to convet all characters to toUpperCase
    and toLowerCase to make all the characters in the string to lowercase. One thing to note is that strings are stored into memory as an array. As such, the first letter of
    the string will have the 0 position of the array. 
</p>

<p>There are two ways we can create arrays. One by creating an object,scores = new Array(39,40,100,49); Or simply declaring it: scores = [39,40,100,49];. 
    To create String Arrays, we start with its creation, names = new Array(30); and then assigning them, names[0] = "John H. Watson"; names[1] = "Sherlock Holmes";
     or names = new Array("John H. Watson", "Sherlock Holmes"); names = ["John H. Watson", "Sherlock Holmes"];
    An intersting method we can utilize is the .split. .split(" "); this will seperate words/characters based on a white space.

</p>

<p>A function is a group of JavaScript statements that can be treated as a single unit. To use a function, you must first define it.
    <pre>function Greet() {

        alert("Greetings!");
    
    }</pre>
    Scripts will not work if the function is not loaded in the head tag of the document.
    
</p>

<p>Objects: </p>
<ul>
    <li>DOM objects—These objects enable your scripts to interact with elements of the web browser and web documents.</li>
    <li>Built-in objects—These include strings and arrays, which you learned about previously in this lesson.</li>
  </ul>
  

<pre>
<code>
The first step in creating an object is to name it and its properties. In this case, you should call your object Card, and it will have the following properties:
name, email, address, phone.

To use this object in a JavaScript we need to create a function to make new instances of the Card object. This is called a constructor for an object.

function Card(name, email, address, phone) {
   this.name = name;
   this.email = email;
   this.address = address;
   this.phone = phone;
}

Next, we need to create a method to work with the Card object. Because all Card objects will have the same properties, it might be handy to have a function that prints the properties in a neat format. 


function printCard() {
    var name_line = "Name: " + this.name + "<br>\n";
    var email_line = "Email: " + this.email + "<br>\n";
    var address_line = "Address: " + this.address + "<br>\n";
    var phone_line = "Phone: " + this.phone + "<hr>\n";
    document.write(name_line, email_line, address_line, phone_line);
 }

 Now we have a function that prints a card and its contents.

 function Card(name,email,address,phone) {
    this.name = name;
    this.email = email;
    this.address = address;
    this.phone = phone;
    this.printCard = printCard; this last part is what defines a function rather than assingning a value. 
 }
</code>
</pre>

<p>The Math object is a built-in JavaScript object that includes math constants and functions. You’ll never 
    need to create a Math object because it exists automatically in any JavaScript program. The Math object’s 
    properties represent mathematical constants, and its methods are mathematical functions. If you’re working 
    with numbers in any way in your JavaScript, the Math object will be your new best friend.
</p>

<p>Rounding and Truncating </p>
<ul>
    <li>Math.ceil—Rounds a number up to the next integer</li>
    <li>Math.floor—Rounds a number down to the next integer</li>
    <li>Math.round—Rounds a number to the nearest integer</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Generating a random number:</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
        function rand(num) {
            return Math.floor(Math.random() * num) + 1;
         }

         Using built-in method: 
         var total = 0;
         for (i=1; i<=5000; i++) {
            var num = Math.random();

            total += num;
        
        }
    </code>
</pre>
<p>Create a Date Object with the keyword new.</p>
<p>Setting Date Values: </p>
<ul>
    <li>setDate—Sets the day of the month.</li>
    <li>setMonth—Sets the month, from 0 for January to 11 for December.</li>
    <li>setFullYear—Sets the year.</li>
    <li>setTime—Sets the time (and the date) by specifying the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.</li>
    <li>setHours, setMinutes, and setSeconds—Set the time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Reading(Getting) Date Values: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>getDate—Gets the day of the month.</li>
    <li>getMonth—Gets the month.</li>
    <li>getFullYear—Gets the four-digit year.</li>
    <li>getTime—Gets the time (and the date) as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.</li>
    <li>getHours, getMinutes, getSeconds, and getMilliseconds—Get the components of the time.</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>Converting between Date formats:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Date.parse—Converts a date string, such as March 1, 2018, to a Date object (the number of milliseconds since 1/1/1970).</li>
    <li>Date.UTC—Converts a Date object value (the number of milliseconds) to a UTC (GMT) time.</li>
  </ul>
