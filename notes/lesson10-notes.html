    <p>Summary for Lesson 22</p>

<p>Variables are named containers that can store different data types. Some rules to follow when naming your variables:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Variable names can include letters of the alphabet, both upper- and lowercase. They can also include the digits 0–9 and the underscore (_) character.</li>
    <li>Variable names cannot include spaces or any other punctuation characters.</li>
    <li>The first character of the variable name must be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
    <li>Variable names are case sensitive; for example, <code>totalnum</code>, <code>Totalnum</code>, and <code>TotalNum</code> are interpreted as separate variable names.</li>
    <li>There is no official limit on the length of a variable name, but it must fit on one line. If your variable names are longer than that—or even longer than 25 or so characters—you might consider a different naming convention.</li>
</ul>
