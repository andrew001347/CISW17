    <p>
        Forms are part of a web page that allows users to enter information to be sent back to:
        you (a specific email address), to a database, or another system altogether such as a 
        third-party management system. POST is a method that allows form entry results to be sent as documents.
        GET submits the results as part of the URL query string instead.  EX:
    </p>

    <code>
        <form name="my_form" method="post" action="myprocessingscript.php">

        <form name="my_form"method="post"action="mailto:me@mysite.com">


    </code>

    <p>The action attribute specifies the address for sending the form data. With each form you can attach
        a label tag with it. A label tag will act as a acption for a form element. To group form elements,
        we can use the fieldset and legend tag. fieldset defines the grouping while the legend contains the text that will
        display or be read aloud to describe the grouping. 
    </p>

    <p>There are many different types of input forms. You can use the checkbox creates a check-list like selector: input type="checkbox" 
        radio buttons: allows for only one box to be checked with input type="radio", selection lists: creates a scrolling lists and pull-down pick lists 
        with select tag with option tag for the list,

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
        There are many types of input users can interact with. Selecting the correct input will depend on what kind of input we want from the users.
        For example, if we want a phone number from them, we would want to specify a input for numbers instead of text.  There are different ways data 
        that could be sent to "you". GET vs POST. I believe GET would be appropriate when data is not sensitive as it would 
        be sent as a url, where as POST would send the results in a document.
