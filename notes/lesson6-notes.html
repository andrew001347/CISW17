    <h2>Summary for Lesson 12</h2>
    <p>There are 2 basic types of layouts: fixed and liquid. In order to master page layout we need a good understanding of the CSS box model and 
        have a professive enhancement mentality when creating web sites. You need to keep in mind that in today's day and age, we must design 
        for mobile devices. 
 </p>

 <p>Having a Fixed Layout is setting up the body of the page to have a specific width. Designers would implement this because they want to have a 
    precise control over the appearance of the content area. The problem with this is that it is not dynamic and will cause problems with devices that
    are much larger or smaller in screen size. A Liquid Layout in the other hand is more dynamic. It can be usable and still retains the overall 
    design aesthetic even if the user has a very small or large screen.
 </p>

<p>3 most commonly used CSS layout:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS table—CSS properties that change the display of page elements to tables, table rows, and table columns.</li>
        <li>CSS flexible box layout—CSS properties that make it easier to lay out, align, and distribute space among elements in a container.</li>
        <li>CSS grid layout—A grid-based layout system with rows and columns.</li>
    </ul>
 <p>There are several table options on the display property:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>table — Behaves like a &lt;table&gt; element</li>
    <li>inline-table — Behaves like a &lt;table&gt; element that is rendered inline</li>
    <li>table-row — Behaves like a table row (&lt;tr&gt;) element</li>
    <li>table-cell — Behaves like a table cell (&lt;td&gt;) element</li>
    <li>table-column — Behaves like a &lt;col&gt; element</li>
    <li>table-caption — Behaves like a &lt;caption&gt; element</li>
    <li>table-row-group — Behaves like a &lt;tbody&gt; element</li>
    <li>table-header-group — Behaves like a &lt;thead&gt; element</li>
    <li>table-footer-group — Behaves like a &lt;tfoot&gt; element</li>
    <li>table-column-group — Behaves like a &lt;colgroup&gt; element</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To build a felxible box container, you can utilize the display: felx property. You then determine what direction the elements in the 
    container are going to flow. You use the flex-direction property with these 4 choices of values: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>row — The flex items flow left to right in LTR (left-to-right) layouts and right to left in RTL (right-to-left) layouts. This is the default.</li>
    <li>row-reverse — The items flow right to left in LTR layouts and left to right in RTL layouts. This is the opposite of row.</li>
    <li>column — Items flow from top to bottom in a column.</li>
    <li>column-reverse — Items flow from bottom to top in a column. This is the opposite of column.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>Then you define how the items will wrap when they come up to the boundary with the flex-wrap property.  </p>

<ul>
    <li>nowrap — All flex items are on one line (horizontal or vertical). This is the default.</li>
    <li>wrap — Flex items wrap to multiple lines from top to bottom.</li>
    <li>wrap-reverse — Flex items wrap to multiple lines from bottom to top. This is the opposite of wrap.</li>
  </ul>
