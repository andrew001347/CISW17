        <h2> Summary for Lesson 1 </h2>
        <p>The Internet came to be when a group of scholars wanted to access and share information accross the states. 
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee made a way to easily cross-reference text on the Internet through hypertext links. And thus his idea
            ofHTML was made. Hypertext Markup Language is a language for describing how text, graphics, and files containing other
            information are organized and linked.</p>

        <p>How we view web content is by having the text and images rendered by web browsers. 3 things are needed to view web content.
            HTML,CSS,and JavaScript.HTML describes the structure, CSS the design,and JavaScript defines the behavior of the content, 
            or how it responds to different conditions.  </p>

        <p>To retrieve web content, a series of processes occur. In its simplest form, people get web content by requesting it to the 
            web server by the web browser. The server would then send a response to the web browser that sends all the information the 
            client/user requests. Browsers assemble the web content components and arrange those parts according to 
            the HTML commands in the file. </p>

        <p>An important thing to consider when developing web sites, is that not every person will view the contents of the web on the 
            same screen, or even devices. It is important to make the website as responsive as possible to cover all cases of device usage.  </p>
